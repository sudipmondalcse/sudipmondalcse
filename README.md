- 👋 Hi, I’m Sudip Mondal, a Computational Biology researcher, working as a Big data Engineer with a skill set of Pyspark, AWS, Azur Databricks, Airflow, SQL, Python, Java, Machine learning, and GitHub.
- 👀 My research interests primarily lie in the field of RNA-seq data analysis and biological big data exploration. I have sharpened skills in Sequence alignment and analysis, de novo transcriptome assembly, survival analysis using diverse statistical and machine learning techniques, and the development of biological sequence databases. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a deep passion for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena.
- 🌱 I’m currently acquiring proficiency in various aspects of RNA-seq data analysis, single-cell analysis, as well as the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methodologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computational Biology, ML research work.
