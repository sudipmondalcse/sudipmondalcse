- 👋 Hi, I’m Sudip Mondal, a Computational Biology researcher, working as a Big data Engineer with a skill set of Spark, Pyspark, AWS, Airflow, Azur Databricks, Airflow, Hadoop, SQL, Python, Java, and GitHub.
- 👀 My research interests primarily lie in the field of RNA-seq data analysis and biological big data exploration. With a strong foundation in these areas, I have honed skills in de novo transcriptome assembly, survival analysis using diverse statistical and machine learning techniques, and the development of biological sequence databases. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a deep passion for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different technologies of RNA-seq data analysis, single-cell analysis, and integrating machine learning(ML) and deep learning techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computational Biology, ML research work.
- 📫 reach me @ sudipmondalcs@gmail.com
